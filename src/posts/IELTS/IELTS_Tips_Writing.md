The line graph compares for countries(The United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and Portugal) regarding the amounts of $CO_2$ released per capita over 40 years.

#### Overview段(最显著的两个特征: 趋势, 拐点, 极值)

Overall, Portugal and Italy **experienced** a **steady rise** in average carbon dioxide emissions per person from 1967 to 2007, while the United Kingdom and Sweden **witnessed** a drop in the past 40 years. **Despite their respective increase and decrease**, the $CO_2$ release per capita in the United Kingdom and Portugal **remained** the highest and lowest of the four countries throughout the period.

#### Detail段1

In 1967, each person in Portugal released fewer than 2 metric tones of $CO_2$, **ranking the lowest among the four countries**. The figure then saw a **steady rise** in the following 40 years to over 5 metric tones in 2007, **equaling the amount for** Sweden. Having experienced a parallel upward trend in the past 40 years, the quantity per person in Italy reached nearly 8 metric tones of $CO_2$ in 1997, and the figure plateaued in the following 10 years, ranking the second among the four countries **by the end of the period shown**.

#### Detail段2

Each Sweden emitted an amount of $CO_2$ over 8 metric tones in 1967. It rose in the following 10 years to a peak of approximately 10 metric tones and began to experience a considerable decrease in the subsequent 30 years, being overtaken by Italy in around 1990. The United Kingdom, the country with the most significant figure in 1967, saw a steady drop in individual $CO_2$ emissions in the following 40 years, and figure declined from nearly 11 to approximately 8.7. Despite this decline, however, the $CO_2$ emissions each Briton contributed to remained the largest in 2007, compared to its counterparts in the other three countries.

复述题目(paraphrase) + 表明立场

People seem to have **contradictory views** concerning(about) advertisements' influence on us: some argue(think/say) that advertising creates a considerable impact upon people's purchase decisions; others, however, consider their ubiquity makes them less influential. While I acknowledge the **validity** of the **former perspective** in **many circumstances**, I am more **sympathetic** to the latter one, believing that in most **scenarios**, current advertising is too **commonplace** to **arrest our attention**.

#### 中间段1(至少5句)

- 第1句: 主题句/中心句

- 第2,3句: 理由1 + 例子

- 第5,6句: 理由2 + ...

On the one hand, advertisements can sway customers' opinions for several reasons. Firstly, advertisers are adept with various advertising strategies to capture consumers' attention and further manipulate their buying behavior. Compare-and-contrast strategies, celebrity endorsement, and previous customers' testimonials, for example, play vital roles in advertising and prove to be effective in many cases; some sellers even tap into psychology fields, studying customers' subconscious and hypnotizing them into buying the product in a subtle yet efficacious way. Secondly, the information gap between sellers and buyers is also responsible for an advertisement's effectiveness. The less information concerning the product users gather prior to a transaction, the more vulnerable they may be to the dazzling advertising slogan.

#### 中间段2(至少5句)

On the other hand, advertisements, even the artful ones, are so widespread that they may **fail to command** as much attention as we assume. Firstly, the current society **is replete with** advertisements, and this makes it extremely hard for any single one to stand out and retain enduring popularity. Secondly, while every seller **spares no effort in** brainwashing his/her target customers with appealing slogans, customers also **build immunity to** seemingly attractive commercials. **My anecdote serves as a compelling example**: when i need to buy something over 100 pounds, I collect **comprehensive information** concerning the product **from mixed sources** and always try to make decisions **based on logical analysis and rational justification instead of on emotions or impulse**. Finally, we must admit that some misleading and even fraudulent advertising does exist, and once the misinformation is discriminated and debunked, those false advertisements will end up **repelling potential customers instead of attracting them**.

#### 结尾(同义改写开头段的立场)

In conclusion, while some people may **be susceptible to** flamboyant advertising, the influence of advertisements is exaggerated in most circumstances.
